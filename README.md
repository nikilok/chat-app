# React + TypeScript + Vite + Vitest

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR, some ESLint rules, and Vitest for testing.

## Testing

This project uses [Vitest](https://vitest.dev/) for unit testing. Vitest is a fast unit test framework powered by Vite, providing:

- ⚡ Fast execution with Vite's build pipeline
- 🔍 Compatible Jest API
- 📸 Snapshot testing
- 🕸 Code coverage reports
- 🎯 UI mode for interactive testing

### Available Test Scripts

```bash
# Run tests once
bun run test

# Run tests in watch mode
bun run test:watch

# Run tests with UI mode
bun run test:ui

# Run tests with coverage report
bun run test:coverage
```

## Development

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
